MaidRatingAnalyticsComponent


Purpose
    MaidRatingAnalytics displays average rating, total number of reviews, and a visual star-wise breakdown of a maid's ratings. It helps maids understand how they're performing based on customer feedback.

| Prop     | Type   | Required | Description                                               |
| -------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `maidId` | String | ✅ Yes    | The Firestore UID of the maid whose reviews are analyzed. |


⚙️ How It Works
    Data Fetching: On mount or whenever maidId changes, it queries the reviews collection in Firestore for all reviews with a matching maidId.

Calculation:

    Computes the average rating.

    Counts how many reviews were rated 5★, 4★, ..., down to 1★.

UI Display:

    Shows average rating numerically.

    Displays a progress bar for each star level (1 to 5).

    Lists total number of reviews.

    Shows a spinner while loading.

🔥 Firestore Collection Used
    reviews: Each document is expected to contain:

    maidId: string

    rating: number (1–5)

🔄 useEffect Logic
    useEffect(() => {
    if (maidId) {
        fetchRatings();
    }
    }, [maidId]);

This ensures ratings are re-fetched whenever a new maidId is provided.
