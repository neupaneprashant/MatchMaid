    import { getAuth, FacebookAuthProvider, signInWithPopup } from "firebase/auth";
    import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
    // import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics"; // optional

    const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "-----------",
    authDomain: "-----",
    projectId: "-------",
    storageBucket: "------",
    messagingSenderId: "---",
    appId: "-----",
    measurementId: "----"
    };

    const app = getApps().length === 0 ? initializeApp(firebaseConfig) : getApps()[0];

    export const auth = getAuth(app);
    export const db = getFirestore(app);
    export const facebookProvider = new FacebookAuthProvider();
